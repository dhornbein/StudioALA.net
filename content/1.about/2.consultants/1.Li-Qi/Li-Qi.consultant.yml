 Ms. Qi trained first as an architect in China and then as a landscape architect in the United States.  She brings a multi-discipline approach to planning and landscape architecture. Being educated in both disciplines attests to her philosophy that to achieve success and beauty in the built landscape one must understand both practices.  She is talented at integrating built forms into the natural environment in a sensitive, ecological manner. Her hand and computer sketching abilities tell the story of a design’s intent.
