<h3>Professional Background</h3>

<p>Ms. Qi trained first as an architect in China and then as a landscape architect in the United
	States. She brings a multi-discipline approach to planning and landscape architecture. Being
	educated in both disciplines attests to her philosophy that to achieve success and beauty in
	the built landscape one must understand both practices. She is talented at integrating built
	forms into the natural environment in a sensitive, ecological manner. Her hand and computer
	sketching abilities tell the story of a design’s intent.</p>
