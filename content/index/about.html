	Studio ALA is an architectural design studio based in Atlanta, Georgia. We design built
	environments where the people who live or work in our buildings have a place that helps them
	realize their aspirations.
</p>

<p>
	We begin each project by asking our client "What are your values and goals?" As designers,
	our objective is to understand the abstract values our client wants embodied in his/her new
	building. From that understanding, agreed upon guiding design principles are established.
</p>

<p>
	Our next step is to conduct an integrated design workshop, during which all members of the
	design team; the owners, the building operations and maintenance personnel, sustainability
	designers, and other appropriate stake holders participate. The objective is to create agreed
	upon program details that adhere to the guiding design principles.
</p>

<p>
	At that point the architectural and engineering drawings are begun with the assurance that the
	design process and construction process proceed from an agreed upon foundation that eliminates
	design problems and minimizes construction difficulties.
