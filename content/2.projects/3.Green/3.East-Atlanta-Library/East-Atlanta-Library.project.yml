 East Atlanta Library is Fulton County’s first LEED® Certified government-owned building.  Some of its sustainable features are the raised flooring that created a plenum for the HVAC system and the electrical wiring.  This allowed the architect to have a dramatic, open, vaulted ceiling without duct work clutter.  All the storm water from the site is conducted to underground cistern vaults where it is percolated back into the soil.  Zero cut-off site lighting, highly reflective roofing, and local building materials were specified.  An exterior design element is the parabolic shaped sun reflectors that allow indirect summer and winter natural light to enter the building.  The reflectors also act as sun shades in the summer cutting off direct sunlight, while allowing direct sunlight to enter the building in the winter to increase passive solar heat gain.
