 The Utoy Creek Building was the City of Atlanta’s first government owned LEED® Certified building.  Its cooling/heating system takes advantage of the waste water treatment plant’s treated water to act as a heat exchange medium.  All the offices in the building have views of the outdoors.  Deep roof overhangs control direct sunlight by shading it during the summer and allowing it to provide passive solar heating in the winter.  Sky lights provide natural lighting to the lab area on the lower level.
