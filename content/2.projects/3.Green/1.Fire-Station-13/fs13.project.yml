 Fire Station 13 was built on a reclaimed brown field site.  It is highly insulated, resulting in on-going energy savings and smaller initial HVAC equipment expenditures.  The major building components; steel, bricks, concrete, and concrete blocks were manufactured locally, resulting in reduced transportation costs.  The paints, adhesives and sealants were low VOC types resulting in reduced toxic off-gassing.  Storm water is retained on-site to reduce flooding and pollution of local streams during the first-flush of rain events.  Some of the rain water is stored for washing down vehicles, saving hundreds of thousands of gallons of treated municipal water normally used for that purpose.
