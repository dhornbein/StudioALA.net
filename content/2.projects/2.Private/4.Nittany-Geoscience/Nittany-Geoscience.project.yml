 Nittany Geoscience is home to a group of hydrologists that share a strong corporate culture distinguished by self-motivated individuals who value open lines of communication and interdependence of the efforts of individual team members.  The owner’s specific wish was that the building promotes the corporate culture and provides a relaxed and pleasant working environment.

 The dominant form of the building is the copper-flaked metal hip roof that mirrors the shape of nearby revered Mt. Nittany.  In a symbolic way, the open office space, the exposed structure, the use of stone, and the visual connection to geological features meet the owner’s’ objectives and represent the nature of the corporation.
