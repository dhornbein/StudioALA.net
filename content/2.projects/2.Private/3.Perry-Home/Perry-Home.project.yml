 The Perry home is located on a mesa overlooking the Santa Re, New Mexico prairie.  The home is off-the-grid and was designed to be completely self-sustainable.  Electrical power is supplied by a 100 square foot array of photo voltaic cells.  The heating is passive solar designed to heat the home for three consecutive cloudy days without relying on the auxiliary, in-slab radiant heating.  In this very dry climate water is scarce.  Large cisterns are located around the home to store snow-melt and rainwater for potable water use during dry months.  Grey water effluent from the on-site septic system is used for irrigation and to flush toilets.
