 Set in a cornfield, this 6500 sq ft home has the form of a traditional Central Pennsylvania farmhouse, but as one enters, the interior immediately expresses the contemporary design.

 The home is heated and cooled by an open loop geothermal heat pump, which extracts or adds heat to water from a water source well and then returns the water to a discharge well.  This system allows the owners to air condition their home without the use of fossil fuel.

 Roof overhangs and deep balconies shade interior rooms from summer sun while allowing winter sunlight to enter the home so passive solar heat can be taken advantage of in the winter.
