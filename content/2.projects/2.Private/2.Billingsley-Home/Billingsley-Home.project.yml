 The Billingsleys bought two adjacent lots on West Roxboro Road and hired our Studio ALA to design a house that fit on the northern lot and preserved the southern lot as a garden.  The new house was to be intimate, in keeping with the Billingsley's active lifestyle, and also provide space for their adult children's families.

 At the core of the house is a small residence for two people, with a Master Suite and Office loft above an open living space with many easily accessed outdoor spaces.

 A common space and two guest bedrooms were placed below the living space.  The design takes advantage of the siteâ€™s steep slope and provides ample natural light to these rooms.

 A third guest living space is located above the attached garage at the back of the site.

 As the Billingsley's wanted this house to be the last house they ever live in, they worked with the design team over every detail to get a level of design and performance not possible in a standard house, and to insure that the house continues to serve them well over the next 20 years.   With these standards in mind the house is equipped with an elevator, geothermal heating, unique kitchen layout, multiple exterior spaces, three-foot wide door openings, and the highest quality materials.
