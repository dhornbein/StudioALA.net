 This $6.5 million, 25,000 sq. ft. facility was developed as a prototype for future regional libraries. The design allows for a flexible interior layout and for modular expansion along the building’s longitudinal axis. For the security of patrons and staff, the librarians are able to monitor activity within the library from all staff locations.

 The Library has a children’s collection, a storytelling room, a reference area with a reference librarian’s office, a large general collection area with computer facilities for adults and children, a staff work area, a Head Librarian’s office, a staff break room and a 100 seat meeting room that is available to the public. The building is a steel frame structure with metal stud walls, a brick veneer and a metal roof. Clerestory windows surround the entire public space, introducing shaded, natural light that gives the roof and ceiling the sense that it is floating.
