 This six-level, 650 car parking deck is part of a fifty acre transit oriented development community
 surrounding the MARTA-Lindbergh rapid transit station that is a principal stop on the City of Atlantaâ€™s
 public transportation system. The parking deck is made of pre-cast concrete double T decking, pre-
 cast spandrels and pre-cast columns. The deck is across the street from the transit station and
 accommodates MARTA riders. It also serves as the parking structure for grocery and retail stores to
 the north and south and apartments directly adjacent to the west.
