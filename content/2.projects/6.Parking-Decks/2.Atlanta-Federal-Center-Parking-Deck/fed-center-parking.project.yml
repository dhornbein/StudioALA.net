 This nine level, 1600 car parking deck, is connected to and serves the Sam Nunn
 Atlanta Federal Center, a federal government office building. The parking deck is
 made of post-tensioned concrete double T decking, cast-in-place beams and columns,
 with a precast exterior finned skin. The three below grade levels are mechanically
 ventilated while the upper levels are naturally ventilated. We were the parking deck
 design firm of record and were responsible for coordinating the deck design with
 structural, mechanical and electrical engineers as well as with the architect of record,
 Kohn, Pedersen and Fox.
