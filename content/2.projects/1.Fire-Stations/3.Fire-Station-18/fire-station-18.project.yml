about: |
 City of Atlantaâ€™s Fire Station 18 is a two-bay,
 10,000 square foot fire station housing a ten-
 person crew. It is the sister station of Station
 13. The energy efficient building will be LEED
 Silver Certified and includes water retention
 chambers that allow the fire fighters to wash
 their vehicles using rainwater instead of
 treated municipal water.
 
 The building plan is laid out so the distance
 from living quarters to fire apparatus is short
 and direct, reducing response time to a
 minimum.
 
 The building construction is load bearing
 concrete masonry with brick veneer. The
 finish materials are tile, concrete block,
 colored concrete flooring and exposed
 ceilings; all designed for durability and ease of
 maintenance. The building is designed for a
 fifty-year service cycle.
