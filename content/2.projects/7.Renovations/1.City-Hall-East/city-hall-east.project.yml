about: |
 Set in a cornfield, this 6500 sq ft home has the form of a traditional Central
 Pennsylvania farmhouse, but as one enters, the interior immediately expresses the
 contemporary design.
 The home is heated and cooled by an open loop geothermal heat pump, which
 extracts or adds heat to water from a source well and then returns the water to a
 discharge well. This system allows the owners to air condition their home without the
 use of fossil fuel.
 Roof overhangs and deep balconies shade interior rooms from summer sun while
 allowing winter sunlight to enter the home so passive solar heat can be taken
 advantage of in the winter.
