about: |
 The renovation of this two story,
 53,000 square foot facility includes
 a new library and reading room as
 well as a new public health
 clinic, new child care facilities, the addition of new job training facilities, renovated office spaces,
 renovated judicial offices, a renovated courtroom, tax collectors offices and public services spaces.
 The building’s HVAC systems were redesigned to meet greater loads and stricter energy
 compliance standards. ADA standards were met during the renovations.
 
 Temporary office space was provided with on-site trailers so the facility’s operations could continue
 without interruption. Staged asbestos mitigation was required prior to demolition of existing
 interior facilities. Substantial under-slab plumbing and additional sewage lines were required.
 
 Studio ALA worked closely with Hogan Construction to meet the aggressive construction
 schedule. Streamlined procedures for shop drawing and submittal reviews, contractor requests
 for information, and Architectural Supplemental Information were instituted so approvals and
 information requests were turned around overnight. As a team, Studio ALA and Hogan were able
 to complete construction on schedule allowing the permanent library, offices and facilities to open
 on schedule.
