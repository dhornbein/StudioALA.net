 The renovation of this two story government service facility included a new library and reading room as well as a new public health clinic, new child care facilities, the addition of new job training facilities, renovated office spaces, renovated judicial offices, a renovated courtroom, tax collectors offices and public services spaces.  The building’s HVAC systems were redesigned to meet greater loads and stricter energy compliance standards.  ADA standards were met during the renovations. 

 Temporary office space was provided with on-site trailers so the facility’s operations could continue without interruption.  Staged asbestos mitigation was required prior to demolition of existing interior partition walls.  Substantial under-slab plumbing and additional sewage lines were required.

 Studio ALA worked closely with Hogan Construction to meet the aggressive construction schedule.  Streamlined procedures for shop drawing and submittal reviews, contractor requests for information, and Architectural Supplemental Information were instituted so approvals and information requests were turned around overnight.   As a team, Studio ALA and Hogan were able to complete construction on schedule allowing the permanent library, offices and facilities to open on schedule.
