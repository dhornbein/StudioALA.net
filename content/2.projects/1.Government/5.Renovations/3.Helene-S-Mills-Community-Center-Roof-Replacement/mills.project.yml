 It became necessary to replace the 10-year old roof at the Helene S. Mills Community Center due to leakage.  The entire metal roof was removed.  Because of the low slope a waterproof TPO membrane was installed beneath a new interlocking metal, standing seam roof and the existing rigid insulation.

 The new roof has a 20 year warranty and has a high solar reflectance index.  New gutters and downspouts were installed along with a new rain garden feature that allows storm water from a new downspout to percolate back into the aquifer.  The building is now leak free.
