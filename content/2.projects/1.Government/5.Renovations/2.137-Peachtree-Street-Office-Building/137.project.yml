 Studio ALA was given the Notice-to-Proceed to provide working drawings for the five floor renovation in mid September, 2009.  The required move-in date was January 1, 2010.  We completed the working drawings on schedule and worked closely with the contractor, Craft-Tech, to answer RFIs and approve submittals as quickly as possible.  Studio ALA added two new rest rooms and renovated existing ones to meet ADA requirements.  The interior floors were refinished, the ceiling tiles replaced, interior walls were painted and exterior walls were restored and painted.  A number of offices were reconfigured.  The original light fixtures were replaced with new fixtures in order to meet current energy efficiency standards.
