name: Fire Station 11

 The City of Atlanta’s new Fire Station 11 is a key component in a new and developing community centered on the Atlantic Station Development. The station is a three-bay, two story facility housing a 14-person crew, and a command center. It serves Atlantic Station, Home Park, West Atlanta, South Buckhead and Midtown.

 Given the modest budget for a facility this size, the prominent location, and the importance of a civic building, it was necessary to economically create a public presence for the building. To do this, the eastern façade of the building is treated like a billboard with a 20 foot high number “11” made from tan bricks. The façade of the building is further enlivened by a regular grid of red framed windows which is interrupted periodically by an underlying structural grid and a vertical arrangement of windows over the doors. The vertical orientation of the windows mirrors the shape of the sky scrapers of mid town creating unique framed views from inside the building.

 The interior of the building is designed to be as maintenance free as possible. Exposed structure and HVAC systems are painted blue and red to add decoration to the interior while minimizing coasts. Interior windows allow light to penetrate deep into the space. The floor plan allows for quick and direct access to the apparatus bay from anywhere within the fire house for quick response times.

 The building construction is steel frame with brick facade.
