 East Atlanta Library is a single story neighborhood library. Along with typical library features, the library has expanded computer facilities, a community meeting room, and an exterior plaza where community events can be staged.

 The building was designed to take full advantage of natural light through the use of clerestories, sunshades and sun reflectors.  An under-floor plenum system eliminates the need for ductwork and economically heats and cools the vaulted ceilings.  Pervious pavement and an underground cistern collects all rain water from the site and slowly allows it to percolate back into the ground.

 The building is steel frame construction with brick veneer and a highly reflective PVC roof.
