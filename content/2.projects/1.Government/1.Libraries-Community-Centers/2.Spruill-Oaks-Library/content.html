This Spruill Oaks Library was developed as a prototype for future regional libraries.  The design allows for a flexible interior layout and for modular expansion along the building’s longitudinal axis.  For the security of patrons and staff the librarians are able to monitor activity within the library from all staff locations.

The Library has a children’s collection, a story telling room, a reference area with a reference librarian’s office, a large general collection area and computer stations for adults and children, a staff work area, a head librarian’s office, a staff break room and a 100 seat meeting room the is available to the public.

Clerestory windows surround the entire public space, introducing shaded, natural light that gives the roof and ceilings the sense that the entire roof is floating.
