 The Garson Deck is part of the parking system for the Lindbergh MARTA Transit Oriented Development.  The parking deck is segmented for use by transit patrons, residents and local shoppers.  

 The six-level, deck is constructed of three, 60 foot wide sections of pre-stressed concrete double Tâ€™s supported on pre-fabricated reinforced concrete shear walls.  Brick facing and intermediate columns reduce the apparent scale of the structure so it relates better to the pedestrian environment and apartment buildings that surround it.
