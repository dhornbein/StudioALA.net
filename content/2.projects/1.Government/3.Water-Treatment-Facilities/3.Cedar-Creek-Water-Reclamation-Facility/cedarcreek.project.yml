 The new Operations Building is part of a five building water reclamation campus set in rural farmland just outside of Athens, Georgia.  The Operations Building houses a conference room, offices, a laboratory and control facilities.

 The Process Buildings were designed to be compatible with the rural setting.  Dormer roofs and decorative brick work give the buildings a rural scale.  High clerestory windows allow light to penetrate deep into the interior creating a light and pleasant place to work.
