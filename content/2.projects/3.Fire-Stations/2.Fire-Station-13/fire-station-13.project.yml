 minimum.

 The building construction is load bearing
 concrete masonry with brick veneer. The
 finish materials are tile, concrete block,
 colored concrete flooring and exposed
 ceilings; all designed for durability and ease of
 maintenance. The building is designed for a
 fifty-year service cycle.
