 This project is a sixty acre mixed-use development. The landscape design scope includes creating a commercial plaza and public park along the frontage road and creating a high-end residential landscape. The landscape and hardscape were designed to capture the character of a natural Scottish landscape to complement the “Old Scottish” theme of the development. Many traditional symbols were used in the design of gathering areas. The general planting design utilized local native plant materials. Berms and curving pathways were interlaced to create interesting and intimate residential spaces.
