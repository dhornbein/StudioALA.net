 Perched on a hill, the central control room has a commanding view of the entire Utoy Creek Water Reclamation Plant. The main entryway passes over a water feature of pools connected by a runnel that cascades sixty feet from the highest to the lowest pool.
 
 Inside, the lobby overlooks the laboratory. The interior windows in the lab allow visitors to observe lab work without disturbing the work or entering the actual lab area. The windows also
 serve to introduce additional outdoor light into the labs, thus reducing the cost of artificial light. A further safety benefit is that the interior of the lab spaces are visible from offices on the floor above, allowing office workers to have visual contact with lab personnel and come to their aid if there is an accident.
 
 Elevators carry visitors to the auditorium where frequent industry conferences and meetings are held. Adjacent to the auditorium is a cafeteria with a balcony that provides outdoor seating and a view of the cascading water.
 
 From the Control Room that overlooks the entire plant, the roofs of the different processing buildings are individually colored to facilitate an explanation of how waste water enters the plant, is processed and leaves the plant as clean, potable water.
