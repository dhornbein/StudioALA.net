 The North Area Water Treatment Facility was a $160 M project to provide a new source of fresh water for Fulton County and the City of Atlanta. Cheeks/Hornbein, Architects developed the project design concept and was responsible for the design and and Construction Observation for three of the five buildings within the facility.

 Because the facility is located within a residential community one of the most pressing design concerns was finding a way to reduce the scale of the large industrial buildings and site them in a way that made them compatible with their residential neighbors. To do this C/H used peaked roofs and contrasting brick colors to create patterns that broke up the large building forms. Buildings were oriented so that their narrow elevations faced the neighboring homes.
