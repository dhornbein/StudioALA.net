about: |
 Part of a five building campus set in rural farmland just outside of Athens, Georgia, the new Operations Building is part of $35M renovation of the Cedar Creek Water Reclamation facility. The Operations building contains a conference room, offices, a laboratory and control facilities.
 
 The Process Buildings were designed to fit in with the rural setting. Dormer roofs and decorative brick work give the buildings a rural scale. High clerestory windows allow light to penetrate deep into the interior, creating a light and pleasant place to work.

 The Athens-Clarke County, Cedar Creek Water Reclamation Center was awarded 1st Prize by the Georgia Chapter American Concrete Institute, 2012.
