 The Perry home is a 2000 square foot home located
 on a mesa overlooking the Santa Fe, New Mexico
 prairie. The home is off the grid and was designed
 to be completely self sustainable. Electrical power is
 supplied by a small array of photo voltaic cells. The
 heating is passive solar designed to heat the home
 for three consecutive cloudy days without relying on
 the auxiliary, in-slab radiant heating. The walls and
 ceiling are heavily insulated. The roof overhang is
 designed to let in sunlight during the winter months
 and provide shade from late March through early
 September.
 
 In this very dry climate water is scarce. Large
 cisterns are located around the home to store snow-
 melt and rainwater for potable water use during dry
 months. Grey water effluent from the on-site septic
 system is used for irrigation and to flush toilets.
 The septic system provides primary and secondary
 treatment so the treated sewage effluent will not
 endanger the environment.
 
 There is a small propane powered emergency
 generator that can be called on to recharge the
 batteries when there are more than three consecutive
 cloudy days. The refrigerator and stove are powered
 by propane gas.
 
 The home is post and beam construction using
 engineered timbers that were fabricated from quick 
 growing trees and recycled plastic. The plastic is
 used in the manufacturing process as the adhesive to
 laminate the wood strands into beams and columns.
 The walls are traditional stucco and the roof is
 galvanized steel.
