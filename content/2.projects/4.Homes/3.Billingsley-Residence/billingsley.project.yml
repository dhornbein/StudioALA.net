about: |
 We placed a common space and two guest bedrooms below the living space. The
 design takes advantage of the sites steep slope and provides ample natural light to
 these rooms.
 
 A third living space is located above the attached garage at the back of the site.
 
 The Billingsley's want this house to be the last house they ever live in.
 They worked with the design team over every detail to get a level of design and
 performance not possible in a standard house, and to insure that the house continues
 to serve them well over the next 20 years. With these standards in mind, the house is
 equipped with an elevator, geothermal heating, unique kitchen layout, multiple exterior
 spaces, three-foot wide door openings, and the highest quality materials
